The following CSS code snippet demonstrates an uncommon issue related to specificity and inheritance:

```css
div {
  color: blue;
}

p {
  color: red;
}

div p {
  color: green; /* This style is overridden */
}

div p:hover {
  color: purple; /* This works as expected */
}
```

The unexpected behavior is that `div p` selector, which should inherit `color: blue` from the `div` and then be overridden by `color: green`, instead only applies `color: green`. This is due to the high specificity of the `div p` selector.

The correct way to ensure inheritance and then override with a more specific selector is to use the `!important` flag.
